                    Purpose:
                    <p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; padding-left: 2%;">I decided to start Daily UI's 100 day design challenge because I felt it would be very important for me to enhance my deisgn skills, and because that this challenge would be the perfect way to do so. If you would be interested in taking on this challenge I'd strongly recommend giving it a shot. To begin the challenge, simply visit <a class="linkborder2" href="https://dailyui.co">dailyui.co</a> and insert your email. The following day you'll recieve the first day's challenge in your inbox, and everyday for the next 100 days, except on weekends which provides a nice break and time to review past challenges. Below are all of my current completed challenges. It would mean the world to me if you gave it a thumbs up on Bƒìhance and or Dribbble. Thank you!</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">This is the first day of Daily UI's 100 day design challenge. I've done multiple takes on this first day of having to create a sign up form.

                    <h3>Day 002 :: Credit Card Checkout</h3>
                    <h5>Deisgn Notes:</h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">For day two, the challenge was to create a credit card checkout page. I decided to go with a checkout page for a mobile app. It's honestly pretty straight forward and simple. Starting from the top, The total amount due is shown with the tax rate listed just below the price. Moving down the screen, we have the actual payment method options. While this challenge was mainly focused on use of a credit card, there are also two express checkout options (PayPal and Apple Pay) that could be used. After a user has populated each of the fields, the lower, "Swipe to Pay" area will lighten up and the arrow will begin sliding from left to right indicating that the user must then swipe to complete their purchase. Again, the design is very simple and quite modern but easy to navigate and understand.</p>

                    <h3>Day 003 :: Landing Page</h3>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">This is the landing page I decided to build for day three. As many can likely guess, it's a mock of IKEA's landing page but with a change in bg color. This landing page features a main element ("Chairs for any room.") that users first see when entering the site. Within that same element is a button directing users to the entire chair collection in the shop. To the right of the main piece, there is a simple 5 button list that offers users easy access to any of the specific things they may be looking for that are listed. I may add more to this in the future, but we'll see. Thanks for checking this out!</p>

                    <h3>Day 004 :: Calculator</h3>
                    <h5>Deisgn Notes:</h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">For day 4 the challenge was to design a calculator, and that I did. When it comes to designing a calculator it's pretty straight forward as to what components and features it needs. While this calculator is on the simpler end, as it doesn't allow for more advanced calculations as the proper buttons to do so aren't in the app, I think we all can agree that this simple calculator can still do a great job at solving random math equations quickly. This calculator also has my favorite feature, one I wish more calculator apps offered, a voice component. Tapping the icon would initiate the voice feature and simply telling it the equation you need to solve will output the answer even quicker.</p>

                    <h3>Day 005 :: App Icon</h3>
                    <h5>Deisgn Notes:</h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">For day five, the challenge was to design an app icon. App icons are something I've never experimented with before. That changed today! The app icon I designed is very modern and while it isn't like most traditional app icons using a basic icon or lettering, mine features a modern logo that I created specifically for this challenge.</p>
                    <div align="right">
                        <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/117359277/Daily-UI-005-App-Icon" class="btn btn-sm smallborderedbutton">View on Bƒìhance &#x2192;</a>

                    <h3>Day 006 :: User Profile</h3>
                    <h5>Deisgn Notes:</h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">For day six the challenge was to create a user profile. So I did, and the design above is what I came up with! I thought it would be neat to have a social app that incorporates¬†emojis in place of basic icons. In each user's profile the users will have the option to set the main¬†colors, choose a¬†background image that uses emojis, and choose their profile picture which also uses¬†emojis. Only text posts would be allowed on this social app as adding pictures could take away from not having a real profile picture. Also, each¬†post has a like feature just like any social app would. What do you think?</p>

                    <h3>Day 007 :: Settings</h3>
                    <h5>Deisgn Notes:</h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">In short, this is a minimal settings page with just about all the necessary settings options. The idea for the app was a mobile gaming platform. Below the username, and beside the user profile image is an "online" button. For the actual settings there's everything from typical Account settings to privacy/security, and even display theme options. Notifications are an important part of a gaming app because it allows each user to know when their friends are playing a video game therefore access to notification options are crucial. Besides those settings options, there's a contact us and support option.</p>

                    <h3>Day 008 :: 404 Page</h3>
                    <h5>Deisgn Notes:</h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">For the 404 page I decided to go with a very minimal page for a cafe. A simple image related to the cafe acts a a great, minimalistic background to the page. Below the 404 error text, is a button directing lost users back home. Again, this page is very minimal however, easy to understand.</p>

                    <h3>Day 009 :: Music Player</h3>
                    <h5>Deisgn Notes:</h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">For day 9 I needed to design a music player. A simple, easy to navigate music player is what I like so that's exactly what I designed. On the first screen (left), users will see a search icon to search a their current songs and albums. Below that is a now playing area allowing users to move to the actual player screen (right) quickly. Below the now playing section is an area where all of a user's albums live. For quick access to the albums users can scroll till they find the perfect one, however as they get more albums, that'll be a nightmare. So there is a button to view all albums in a full list on a separate screen. Moving to the player screen we can see the search button still remains and just beside it are a more options icon, allowing users to view more info on the album or song they're listening to and a favorite/heart icon that allows users to easily save songs and albums to the favorites section. Further down the screen is the literal player where users control the part of the song they're listening to, loop or shuffle an album/playlist, and pause or play a song.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">The tenth day asked for a social share component/feature to be designed. The feature itself is quite straightforward and easy to understand. The coloration with a black and white contrast is something I thought would be different and appealing. That it is.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">For day 11 the challenge was to design a flash message for both a success and error. I decided to make my flash message for a newsletter sign up, informing the user wether or not they were successfully signed up or not. I honestly wasn't sure how my designs would look, but as you can see they turned out fairly decent.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">For day twelve, the challenge was to create a single item in an e-commerce shop. I wanted the design to be simple as I personally hate e-commerce sites that are hard to navigate and give every user a headache. Color themes can be overwhelming at times on various shopping sites too, so the colors for mine are simple and provide a warm feeling to each users. Under the product image and description is an add to cart button. Below that, a row of similar products is shown. While this design is minimalistic, it's also very pleasing to users.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">For day 13 the challenge was to create a direct messaging application. I designed this messaging app with ease of use in mind. In this design, I made sure that a user could easily navigate in and out of messaging with friends using the return to inbox button in top left corner of the app. In the top right, a user can click on their friend's profile picture to view that user's full profile. It's minimal, the color theme isn't overwhelming and it achieves exactly what was challenged.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">Day 14 involved creating a countdown timer. I choose to design one for an app. Starting at the lower, navigation portion of UI, there are three options: a clock, a countdown and a stopwatch. Each of these options are all very standard on most time tracking apps and sites, however changing the layout and adding a fast way to navigate between each time tracking option is crucial. In the center of the screen, the physical countdown is located, encouraging the user as they near the end of the set time. Above the timer, in the top right is the user's icon, keeping track of their past countdowns and stopwatches, as well as their favorited world clocks. In the top left is a create new countdown icon allowing a user to create up to 4 countdowns at one time. Each being displayed in a two by two, stacked format.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">For these On/Off Switches I chose to design them as  toggles between dark and light mode and they're fairly simplistic as most toggle switches are.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">Day 16 called for the design of a pop-up/overlay. This overlay is shown after a user purchases honey from this online shop. It informs the user that their order was successfully placed and allows them the option to get a receipt sent to their email inbox. Below the company name, is an x icon allowing users to close out of the overlay and return to the app or website. While this overlay is minimalistic, it achieves everything a user would need to know and do after making a purchase.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">Email receipts are typically overcomplicated and far from easy to understand. With that being said, the email receipt I've designed is one that any user can understand. This receipt reminds the user of what they ordered and the total cost, as well as allows them to track their order. This email receipt displays all the essentials that every customer would ever need to know.</p>

While it's minimal, this app could be a great way for users to track their investments as well as decide on future investments.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">For day 20, the challenge was to design a location tracker. Wether this app be used for setting destinations and choosing the fastest routes like most maps, or tracking you and your friends and family, it can do it all. The map is enlarged upon opening showing the user's current location. A quick search would allow the user to find places he/she would like to travel to. For quick searches, the app offers quick links to things such as restaurants, parks, stores, and supermarkets and others, based on the user's most frequented searches. While this design is quite minimalistic, it certainly offers the same features and more of most map apps.</p>

Other, not frequently used devices, can be accessed from the "more" screen of the app. It can be visited by selecting the three dots in the bottom navigation tab. The design is simple and easy to understand, allowing the user to quickly and efficiently control and check on all the smart devices within their home.</p>

This app was designed with quick access to specific games in mind. In the nav, various popular sports are listed, below that is a live section for every currently live game. Continuing down the screen, a list of popular universities, based on the user's watch history and favorited teams, allows for quick access to on-demand sports and live. U Sports the perfect streaming app for any college sports fan.</p>

The general content of a calendar app is pretty straight forward, therefore it comes down to designing a stunning theme and fully accessible features.

A user can choose their desired meal before even arriving at a restaurant, therefore a digital menu should be concise. A digital menu that's overcrowded can cause a user to feel overwhelmed and not important. A complex UI could ultimately change the users mind on where to order from based on how easy it is to a restaurants digital menu. This menu is modern and concise, keeping the user in mind.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">This is an activity feed screen that informs a user of all their follower's activity relating to their account. Simply pressing the activity notification a user wants to view, will open it. This design is minimal, modern, and unique. I chose the yellow, white, and black color theme as the colors complement each other pretty well and each are subtle. </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">On the lock screen, a user can view their recent notifications. These particular notifications are for an app I've been working on recently that allows users to pre-order food from food trucks. Alerts like these inform users of when and where a food truck will be. Notifications must be concise to overwhelm the user. An alert that's too wordy can cause a user to simply erase it without ever opening.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">Firstly, I must say that I am now halfway through Daily UI's 100 day challenge and I cannot express how excited I am to have reached this major checkpoint. These 50 challenges have gone by quick, but I've truly enjoyed each one so far. It's important that job listings are not cluttered, but instead concise. Companies may have low response ratings to a job listing if users of a job search platform can't understand the job requirements or submit an application. This job search app has a layout that makes it easy for the user to learn about a company, read job requirements, and apply to jobs because the app uses clearly labeled buttons, simple icons, accessible colors, and concise labels.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">This press page informs media outlets of their brand's style guidelines such as logo and font usage. A press page must be concise and minimal, giving publications all necessary resources while saving them time.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">This logo is for an app I've been designing for Google's UX design certification course. The app will allow users to order from food trucks, therefore a food truck icon is used in the logo along with the app name "street side" below it making this logo is modern, simple, and easily recognizable. The color theme for the logo is black and white as the app I'm designing also uses this theme.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">These are two minimal headers that feature navigation links using text and icons. Both headers are concise and allow a user easy access to the most important links. The first header could be used in a software as it includes links to a user's dashboard, account, and settings. The second header could be used for a social app as it allows a user to directly access their profile, settings, notifications, search, and menu.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">Icon sets are extremely helpful to both designers and developers as they provide a consistent collection of icons to use for an app, website, or software. Icons are great to use for navigation when text isn't a good fit, therefore the icon must be easily recognizable and concise.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">Breadcrumbs aren't a feature that gets a lot of credit however they can be very helpful in an application, website, or software. Breadcrumbs allow a user to view the directory to where they are in the directory. If the breadcrumbs are links, then a user can easily return to a previous screen. I feel breadcrumbs are underrated and are always worth putting into any project.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey;">Shopping carts or shopping bags are common in digital shopping apps and websites. A shopping cart must be concise so a user knows exactly what they're ordering. Using light colors, such as the blue used in this design, is better than using dark, vibrant colors that can cause a user to feel uncomfortable and overwhelmed.</p>
